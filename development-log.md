# Status Update 1

September 4th, 10 am:
* I have now a functional quiz. It currently stops once you have answered 3 questions correctly. This will be changed to 10 at the end, but while I'm still testing if things work, it's better to keep it at 3.
* The quiz app now contains the following components: 1 file with the questions, one file with the menu, and one file with the actual quiz.
* My next steps are to add a way for people to add their high score to a list, possibly a CSV file and adding error handling so that people don't type in anything other than what they are supposed to.
* Once all of that is done I want to research some cool gems to make my app look a little nicer. But that's something I'm only going to do once everything else is functional, including the game, the menu and the high score list.
